            <p>This scenario demonstrates creating a DatePicker control with a specific initial 
                value using imperative and declarative methods.  Note that The DatePicker and TimePicker controls
                are very similar so as some demonstrated scenarios may show techniques using a DatePicker control, 
                the same pattern can also be applied to the TimePicker control.
