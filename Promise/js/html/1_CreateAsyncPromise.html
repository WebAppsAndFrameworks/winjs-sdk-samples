            <p>A Promise is an object you can pass around that represents a value which may not yet have been computed, 
                an error which has not yet been found or some work which has not yet been performed.
                Promises can be chained together using Promise.then to schedule work when a value from the previous chain is available 
                to synchronize a series of asyncronous work or events.
                <br />
                In this example, we are going to add 1+2+3+4 using promise chaining.
