        <p>The WinJS.Navigation.history property is settable. This is useful when you wish
            to save and restore your navigation history, for example when your application
            has been resumed from suspension.
        </p>
        <p>The code for this scenario demonstrates saving the navigation history to
            session state and restoring it.
